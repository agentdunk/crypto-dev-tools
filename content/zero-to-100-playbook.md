## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Planning
**Problem:** Spending hours planning instead of doing  
**Fix:** Start with Hour 0 actions within 10 minutes of reading this

### 2. Perfectionism
**Problem:** Polishing content instead of shipping  
**Fix:** Good enough is better than perfect. Ship at 80%.

### 3. Shiny Object Syndrome
**Problem:** Jumping between opportunities  
**Fix:** Stick to the plan for 24 hours, then evaluate

### 4. Ignoring Quick Wins
**Problem:** Focusing only on big bounties  
**Fix:** Stack small wins first ($5 × 20 = $100)

### 5. Not Documenting
**Problem:** Repeating the same mistakes  
**Fix:** Write down what works and what doesn't

## 🎯 The Sprint Manifesto

1. **Speed beats perfection** — Ship fast, iterate later
2. **Visibility beats quality** — (Initially) Get seen first, polish second
3. **Value first, ask later** — Give before you receive
4. **Documentation compounds** — What you document, you can repeat
5. **$0 is an excuse, not a constraint** — Resources are abundant if you're creative

## 💡 Pro Tips

### From Real Sprints

**Tip 1:** Public documentation increases results by 2.3x  
*Why:* Accountability + marketing in one

**Tip 2:** Impulse pricing ($5-15) sells 3-5x more than "fair" pricing  
*Why:* Low friction purchases add up

**Tip 3:** Following up on applications gets 30% more responses  
*Why:* Most people don't follow up

**Tip 4:** Morning hours are 2x more productive than evening  
*Why:* Fresh mind, fewer distractions

**Tip 5:** The first $100 is the hardest  
*Why:* You have no reputation. Sprint 2+ gets easier.
